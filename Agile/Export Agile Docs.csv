The reason for this is to avoid accessing the Canvas until it is called by a draw function. Text parser's Read File function should only read the file, and not Draw the shapes as well. Sorry for not making this clear earlier.

Line - ID number (int), front point(QPoint), end point (QPoint) @ltep0 
Polyline - ID Number (int), pointer to QList of QPoints (QList<QPoint>*) 
Polygon - done @campjake 
Rectangle - ID Number, Position (QPoint), length (int), width (int) @HardinL 
Ellipse - ID Number (int), Position (QPoint), major axis point (int), minor axis point (int)
